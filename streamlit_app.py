The final model is a multiclass logistic regression, allowing the app to show

### 🏢 Peer-Relative Context
Companies are evaluated relative to peer benchmarks rather than in isolation,
which makes the analysis more realistic and financially meaningful.

### 🔗 End-to-End Analytics Workflow
The app reflects a full pipeline from raw financial and market data to feature engineering,
